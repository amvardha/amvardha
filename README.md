## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

 - I'm a Full-Stack Software Developer with demonstrated expertise in Python, Angular and Golang
 - I've worked closely with CyberSecurity, Deep Learning and Drones.
 - I love learning new things about different parts of computer science
 - Besides work, I code in my free time, code while eating and code while I sleep :)
